---

This data analysis project explores the relationship between weather conditions and bicycle usage, based on a publicly available dataset provided by Dicoding. The dataset contains daily records of bike rentals along with corresponding weather variables, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

The objective of the project is to identify patterns and correlations between environmental factors and the number of bicycles rented. Key steps in the project include:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, transforming data types, and generating additional temporal features (e.g., day, month, weekday).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends in bike usage across different seasons, weather types, and temperature ranges using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Correlation Analysis: Evaluating the strength of relationships between numeric weather features and bike rental volume.
- Statistical Insights: Drawing conclusions on how weather variations influence user behavior and proposing data-driven recommendations for bike rental operations.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Python for real-world data analytics, using tools such as Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries to extract insights that could support decision-making in urban mobility or micro-mobility planning.

## A glimpse of bike-sharing
Data Set Information:  
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.
Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

## üìä Business Question 1: How does weather affect the number of bike rentals?
‚úÖ SMART Breakdown
S (Specific): Analyze the impact of weather factors (rain, temperature, humidity, wind speed) on the number of bike rentals.
M (Measurable): Measure the correlation and trend patterns of weather variables against the rental count.
A (Achievable): Can be answered through regression analysis and visual data exploration.
R (Relevant): Useful for operators to plan fleet capacity based on weather forecasts.
T (Time-bound): Can be analyzed daily or monthly over the past year.
<br>
Yes, weather has a significant impact on the number of bike rentals per day and per hour. This is evidenced by data visualizations showing a noticeable increase in bike usage during:
- Clear weather conditions
- Peak seasons, particularly fall and summer
- Peak hours: around 8 AM (commute to work) and 5‚Äì6 PM (commute from work)
This usage pattern indicates that the majority of bike sharing users are working professionals who rely on bikes as a commuting option when the weather is favorable.

## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Business Question 2: Is there a difference in rental behavior between registered and casual users?
‚úÖ SMART Breakdown
S (Specific): Compare rental patterns between registered and casual users.
M (Measurable): Analyze rental counts by user type.
A (Achievable): Feasible through exploration of the casual and registered variables.
R (Relevant): Useful for shaping marketing and user retention strategies.
T (Time-bound): Can be observed on a weekly or monthly basis.
üìä Answer & Insight
Analysis of the data and visualizations reveals clear behavioral differences:
- Registered users:
  - Rent bikes more frequently, especially during workdays.
  - Peak usage occurs at commute times (morning and evening).
  - Prefer riding during clear visibility seasons like fall and summer.
  - Show increased activity towards the end of the workweek (e.g., Fridays).
- Casual users:
  - Tend to ride more during weekends, especially on Sundays.
  - Less influenced by work hours and more aligned with leisure behavior.
 
## Conclusion
‚úÖ Yes, weather significantly affects bike rental volume. The better the weather (clear skies, warm temperatures), the higher the number of rentals.
‚úÖ Registered users ride more frequently than casual users‚Äîespecially on workdays and during commute hours‚Äîwhereas casual users are more active on weekends.
‚úÖ Seasons with good visibility and comfortable temperatures (e.g., fall and summer) see the highest usage across both user types.
